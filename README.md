# Microsoft-Qrise2024-challenge
How far away is a fault-tolerant realization of promising quantum algorithms? How many qubits are needed, and how noisy can they be? In Microsoftâ€™s challenge, you will employ the Microsoft Azure Quantum Resource Estimator to map out the path towards a fault-tolerant quantum future.
